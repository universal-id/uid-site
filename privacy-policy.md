# Privacy policy

**We do not store any of your data. Period.**

We physically can’t. We have nowhere to store it. We don’t even have a server database to store it.  So even if a nation state asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show them.

**We host this site using GitHub pages.**

Please refer to GitHub's privacy policy for GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages). They state the following:

>"Please note that GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service."
